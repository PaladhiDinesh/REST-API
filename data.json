From the very beginning, when i was trying to decide between the Galaxy S7 and the Iphone7, which i rather disliked because I'm not a fan of Apple products, it was about which phone was more durable because i work a lot, but I also wanted a phone that felt awesome to own. From the moment they opened up the box to show me the model, this phone just felt SPECIAL! It was different, and it was me all the way. First impression- It came in a smooth, hardcover box that said 32GB right on it, so you know it's got lots of room for apps. and it came with a pair of call receiving enabled headphones, so you can already listen to music and take calls. The phone can take and send video in 4K definition. The phone is compatible with VR technology. This phone is absolutely as smart as they can be and it's also almost completely waterproof, and it's all on the most reliable network (i can get service when i go hunting and fishing in the middle of the woods).

That helps so you don't go to bed with your phone plugged in and when it's done charging it doesn't just continually burn up the battery. You charge it as its needed and that's that.

I can go a whole day without charging until night time and then there are days I do have to charge during the day. It all depends on how I use my phone. I have a lot of apps that was transferred from the Galaxy  S5 but haven't activate all of them. If I had activated all of them, then I would be charging my phone twice or more a day.  BTW  I like the new style charger because the the hardly feels hot to the touch.\r\n\r\nI do have minor complaints.\r\n1- Not happy with a removable battery. It was the only I could shut off my other phones when they froze. This phone hasn't frozen so far.\r\n2- Being made of glass. More of a risk of being cracked. That was one of the reasons why I didn't want the iPhone.\r\n3- Needs sensitivity touch control when wearing gloves in the winter which they had on the Galaxy S5.\r\n4- Needs voice commands when using a Bluetooth when driving. I had that command when I had a flip phone (I forgot which cell phone company had that. All I had to do was press the button on my Bluetooth and the voice commands came on.) so why can't a smart phone have it without going to the PlayStore and downloading Google Voice? It should be automatically programmed into the phone just like my old flip phone?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I am very happy with the phone.

The responsiveness is vastly improved. The extra memory (32G vs 16G) allows for many more apps. I had hit the limit with the S4. The camera works the way that you would expect a good one to work. The one in the S4 was more often than not a disappointment. The S7 camera focuses nearly instantaneously and can be set to track and stay focused on the object (person, hawk flying, etc.). The delay in the S4 was always frustrating and it would often re-focus on the wrong object in the frame.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of is the need for a good protective cover. The phone is slippery! I purchased a Spigen cover with a protective plastic edge that both looks great and is functional. It does not cover the side buttons. I might switch to one like I had on the S4 that does cover the buttons because it is too easy to accidentally press the power button on the side and wake the phone, but that's in the personal preference area. The cover should have a ridge above the screen because on the S7 the glass sits proud of the edge, exposed in a drop.\r\n\r\nThe battery life is much better than it is in the S4 as well.\r\n\r\nI can say that I haven't found anything negative to report on the S7 itself.

I dropped my phone (inside an otter box defender case) from a 12' roof into water about 4\" deep. I didn't realize it had fallen out of my nail bags but when I found the phone, it still functioned fine. I attribute the 'crash protection' of the case to the drop protection but the phone its self did not allow water to enter, as advertised.\r\n\r\nThe new version of Android is easier to use in some ways, but some features are a little harder to find. Such as stopping the download manager, and the developer features. But this is partly learning curve for the newest android version. Texting over a wifi network is also a great benefit for me. Overall the phone and the Android OS are working well with no issues. I remain solidly convinced that Samsung makes one of the best phones on the market at the moment.\r\n\r\n1. Battery life under heavy use with wifi and Bluetooth on is about 14 hours. I have stretched that to 4 days without charging if I turn on the power saving features in the settings drop down.\r\n2. Call quality is outstanding and easy to hear and understand even on speaker. \r\n3. Charging time is rather short, about an 45 minutes- hour from 1% to 100% even when all features (wifi, bluetooth) are still on. \r\n4. Camera functions well, taking great photos in all conditions so far. The magnify feature is also VERY useful for me and shows an extremely clear close up view of anything that is more than 5 inches from the camera.\r\n5. The Google play app for music is a little hard to navigate, but I don't listen to much music on my phone.

I especially love the new themes you can get for your whole phone to change how all the apps as well as background looks. Instead of individualizing each area, it is all in one theme. Downside is that there are very few that are free but the cost to buy one is cheap so I like my phone very personalized, so its worth it to me! I was used to being able to slide through about 4 or 5 app pages on the home screen, but Samsung has combined them into a 2 page apps view and there are combined app buttons to put all of Googles apps into one file etc so you dont have to scroll so much to find what you need.

Of course, nothing's perfect, but with each generation I have never had problems with the phone freezing, being frustratingly slow, or not working properly. If you take care of this phone, it will take care of you.\r\n\r\nPros: Fast, lots of space, looks great, menu/settings are familiar (so you don't have to learn a whole new settings scheme. This makes it so easy to pick up and go from the previous generations). Although I've used Atom Launcher on my S3, 5, and now 7, the new \"Themes\" option makes it so easy to customize the look of your phone, I wouldn't be surprised if Atom Launcher can't keep up.\r\n\r\nCons: \"Always on\" feature...it's a good idea, I use it, but I haven't notice it save the battery at all. In fact, the battery seems to drain faster on the S7 than the S5. Body design...although the phone looks so awesome, you really need to purchase a phone case.

The water proofing is also amazing!  I've submerged it in a glass of water for about 25ish minutes and it works just fine.  There have been occasions where I've even taken it to a pool to shoot some video and pictures and nothing bad happened.  Just make sure you don't leave it in the pool for more than 30 minutes just for safe keeping.  The body is extremely easy to hold and all buttons are easily accessible. Some extra perks are the fingerprint scanner, super high resolution screen and the wireless charging capabilities! So far I LOVE this phone and this is after six years of iPhone usage.  Best phone on the market and I'll recommend this phone to ANYONE!

The heart rate monitor is on the back next to the camera, you just press your finger to it and it records your heart rate. You can then tell it what you were doing at that time: resting, after exercise, before exercise, etc. The camera is fantastic, the standby battery life is pretty decent, screen is a great size neither too big nor too small, screen resolution is amazing.

I can honestly say I haven't had any issues with the phone's app performance. The camera is amazing. It focuses so fast and it the pics are so beautifully sharp. I feel this phone is almost perfect and it's making me kind of arrogant because it's so awesome I keep telling people about it without them even asking!\nAlso, I used to think what's the big deal about cellphones. They all do the same things and basically look the same. That was my mindset until I started using this baby. I feel like I'm holding a long lost treasure. I have the gold version and I love looking at it let alone using it. It's kind of hypnotic.\nI said earlier that this phone is almost perfect, because the main thing that it is supposed to do which is phone calls, is definitely lacking. I have had multiple people tell me that they couldn't hear me very well and that I was cutting in and out but I could hear them just fine. That really irks me because I like smartphones but I believe above all else any phone should not have major issues with calls. Instead this phone is like an awesome portable computer with a poorly working phone built into it.\nI still gave it 5 stars because I think that the call quality is not a deal breaker considering how amazing everything else about the phone is.

The phone has all day battery and I'm not jumping to go dunk my phone in the water. Double tap the home button and the camera is off and going fast. Fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast although I don't really use it except to verify a purchase. If Touch Wiz isn't your thing, it's incredibly easy to load keyboards, launchers, that are more to your liking (I prefer Google keyboard and voice to text it comes with). The things that Samsung offers with this keyboard really change the look of the phone. There are several free options to choose from or you can buy one to your liking. Wireless charging is another win, charging my phone through an Otterbox Defender case. Fast charging with the stock charger works and charges more quickly than wireless (I used my old Verizon tilt charger from my last phone rather than buy a Samsung fast wireless charger). If you have a bunch of mini USB/wireless charging accessories, they should all work with this phone which is actually another reason I picked the s7. Call quality through Bluetooth and with the phone itself is excellent. Samsung Milk Music is worth the nominal monthly fee for no ads, no DJ, and the ability to stream music without burning up internet, it does it offline through the app. Gaming is good, I've heard people comment about covering the speaker but I've had no problems whatsoever. There is a dedicated gaming app that allows you to block notifications, record and share your gaming experience if that's your thing. Speaker is clear and sounds like what a single cellphone speaker should, no issues with speakerphone, but don't expect stereo quality. Overall I'm really happy with the smaller form factor even being at bifocal age coming from a Nexus 6 with a 6\" screen. I can read everything clearly.

After about one day of using it, I was hooked on this phone.\n\nPros:\n\n-- Beautiful screen with vivid colors\n-- Size is about perfect for me. I don't want anything bigger.\n-- It's really fast. Apps open and run very quickly. Fingerprint recognition is really fast.\n-- I could write a ton on ease of use. It's very easy to navigate and do stuff. In my opinion, even easier than an iPhone. I love the ability to close all Apps at once by clicking a single button. It's so easy to transfer files (such as music) from your PC by just clicking and dragging. Bye-bye iTunes and all it's issues!\n-- Battery life is about the same as an iPhone, based on my usage profile. You can get a full day's worth of use without recharging if you aren't on it constantly, and/or playing games.\n-- You can get a lot of extra battery life by activating Power Save Mode.\n-- Charges in about 1 hour and 15 minutes with fast charger.\n-- Camera is awesome.\n\nCons:\n\n-- No easy way to sync with Outlook for contacts. There are some 3rd party apps that do this, but they aren't as good as iTunes.\n-- Slow motion video camera doesn't allow you to zoom.

Though I'm still disappointed Samsung made the decision not to release a white colored phone here in the US (as it's personally my favorite color), I'm really loving the gold color and how it changes tone in different lighting! The fingerprint visibility is unfortunately very high, but it isn't a deal breaker. The phone itself is great and an incredible upgrade from the S4 (which I have loved dearly over these last two years); the size is only an inch bigger and it's more narrow than the S4, which is a plus for someone with small hands like me! The battery life is SUCH an upgrade from the S4, and though I don't think it's quite as good as advertised and reviewed, it's still fantastic. The longest I've gone without a charge (and I haven't even let it fully die yet) is well over 8 hours, and even then it was only down to 15% with extremely heavy use. The camera on this phone is fantastic, too; I have no idea what the S6 camera was like, but the S4 was far from cutting edge. I spent a day taking pictures in various lighting and every single one has turned out great! I'm also extremely glad that expandable storage is back because it's a necessity these days. My only complaint is that I did not receive an SD Card Tray Removal Tool with my phone like I was supposed to, and since I live in a dorm with significantly less things around than I would have had at home, I ended up having to unbend a staple to get it open. The phone is fantastic, and the fast charger included is REALLY fast - it literally charges my phone 10% in five minutes. I haven't tested the extent of water resistance yet, but one of my friends got the phone as well and was bold enough to pour a cup of water over it with no damage whatsoever, so it looks like it's well done!

After a year and half I was noticing overall slower performance and heating issues.\r\n\r\nWhere the S6 abandoned all the good things about the S5, the S7 brought them back. I threw in a 200 GB memory card for all my music and photos, and the 32 GB capacity overall is much better for apps you want directly on your phone. The processor is FAST. Opening apps and browsing the web are a snap. The camera is beautiful - quick, crisp, clear. \r\n\r\nThe transition over from my S5 to the S7 was also incredibly painless. I was able to hook the 2 phones to each other with a piece included in the S7's packaging, and within an hour my new phone had all the apps, photos, messages, contacts, and videos my old phone had.\r\n\r\nThe dust and water rating on the S7 are a huge plus. I did like that my S5 was water resistant, but the bulky charger flap was kind of awkward. this phone has removed all awkward bulkiness, including the protruding camera bump (the back is now more smooth and even rounded to hold).\r\n\r\nI also got a wireless charging pad for my phone, and I think it's really cool.

No floating toolbox, but that is downloadable.\r\n\r\nI recommend getting some kind of case, because the exterior shows all smudges and smears because it is such a slick, shiny phone.

I simply backed everything up (which took the longest amount of time), and then turned on the wireless transfer app (Android Beam) and touched them together and bam! All my stuff was transferred to my new S7 in a matter of minutes - flawlessly. I was impressed with how fast the phone charges - minutes, I mean literally minutes, folks. The fingerprint log in is outstanding and easy to set-up and use. Pictures are beautiful, even though the rear is only 12mp's; and the front camera is just as good, even at only 5mp's. The low light setting for the camera is just - wow! On my S4 a dark room would have been completely blacked out; however, on the S7 it is visible, albeit with a yellow hint, which is to be expected from such low lighting. I don't plan on taking too many pictures in a dark room, so think I can deal with that. Love how the apps for Verizon, Google, and Amazon are grouped into one icon - fabulous - takes up less space in the apps pages. On my S4, I had 4 or 5 pages of apps; now I have 3 pages total. I took it to work with me on Saturday and the battery lasted all day long - it has yet to go below 65% without needing a charge. I topped it off this morning before going to work, and right now it is still at 87% - this is fantastic. My old S4 would have to be charged everyday - not the S7. Of course the real test will come on Thursday when I am off, and can really sit and play with it. Then we'll see how long the battery lasts before needing a charge. So, so far, I can't say enough about this phone. I have used the alarm to wake me up for work, and it is great at waking me on time. Texting is simple and pretty much the same as with the S4 I had, with the exception of the new emoticons added - I really like them. The screen is beautiful. And the fact that I have small hands, with it being narrower, I can actually use the phone one handed, where I couldn't with my S4. My S4 has now been passed on to my husband, and he is really loving it. I may have just created another Galaxy fan! Thanks Samsung and Verizon for another wonderful Galaxy product. I will update this review later when I have a little more time with my new S7 - but so far - I absolutely love it!

I finally decided it was time to move into the modern world and upgraded from a basic flip phone. \r\nThe Galaxy S7 is stylish, fast, and can do everything my iPad Air can do. \r\nThe set up was simple. I had sent my contacts through Backup Assistant to the cloud and by the time I finished going through the set up steps, my contacts and pic were on my new phone. \r\nI connected to my Wi-Fi at home and updated the operating system, installed a few apps and I was all set. \r\nUse of the phone is extremely intuitive. I like it better than the smartphone my wife has from a different manufacturer that shall remain nameless. \r\nMy voice sounds like it is in a chamber when I listen on my wife's phone, but her voice is crystal clear on mine. She has had issues with voice quality from other phones before. \r\nI highly recommend the S7.", "Submission Time": "2016-03-13", "Title": "Fantastic", "Username": "DandelionMan"}, {"Review": "Years ago I tried android and didn't like it. I have been on Iphone for a long time. But I have grown so tired of Iphone that last summer I switched to windows phone. Still not what I was looking for. I started looking for a good android phone so I could give them another try. In my search I saw that Samsung was releasing a new Galaxy soon. So as I read rumors and expected features I grew anxious. Then when the announcement came and all the rumors were correct I said this is the phone for me. I pre ordered my Galaxy S7 and received it before the official sale date. I am super excited. Ok enough on how I got to android. Now about the phone. \r\nThis is the best phone I have ever held in my hands. Super fast, Expandable storage, Large Battery, Wireless Charging, Water Proof, Amazing Camera, And able to be customized to what ever your liking is. Samsung listens to what the customers want. Something Apple does not do. \r\nI have been on Android for 5 days now and I am loving it compared to IOS and windows phone. If Samsung keeps putting out products like this they have a life long customer. But because I love this phone so much I doubt I will be trading it in when the next galaxy comes out. I'll hang on to this one for at least 2 years. Besides its going to be very very hard to top the very best phone ever made. \r\nBy the way, Wireless Charging is very fast. I also bought the Samsung Fast Wireless Charger. Well worth it. I also purchased a Case-Mate barely there Clear case and a tempered glass screen protector. \r\nIf any of you are IOS users or Windows phone users that are thinking of switching over to Android give the Samsung Galaxy S7 a try. I am sure you will be just as pleased with it as I am. \r\nI highly recommend this phone.

I am so pleased I decided on the Galaxy S7! It charges very quickly and so far the battery lasts a long time, and I use my phone quite a bit. It doesn't lag at all and is very fast. The camera is awesome! I don't notice much of a difference from my LG with the front facing camera, but the rear facing one is amazing! No lag time when taking pictures either. The \"Always on\" display is a neat feature, and it doesn't seem to be affecting battery life yet, but I will be turning it off if it starts.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I do find rather annoying is the fingerprints. I got the gold phone and wow does it show fingerprints. I have a case on it so it's not an issue but I feel like I could never display it without the case.

As a result both are susceptible of falling and getting lost.

I don't really understand why. The security screen is the same function, so why the need for the swipe, too?\r\n2. My S5 recognized when you were in a \"familiar\" location and would bypass the security screen. The S7 started to do that, but then stopped for no apparent reason. I'll have to chat with Service to figure out how to enable that feature because all my efforts to figure it out on the Settings screens have been for nought.\r\n3.

I've had the S7 for two weeks now and the main issue is how people sound when using HD Voice activated to when HD Voice is disabled (FYI: I don't use HD Video Calls).  With HD Voice on, the people I'm talking to either sound like they are talking to you from under a blanket or in a closet, or their is a strange echo as other sounds are disproportionately being picked up.  Voice calls sound better and more natural with HD Voice turned off.  BUT, if you do that, you cannot simultaneously be on a call and use any app that needs data access.  It didn't used to be this way.  But, now that technology is evolving so phone only have and only use one type of antenna (4GLTE), and not multiple antennas, you cannot use data while on a phone call if HD Voice is disabled.  So, I suffer through the lower quality voice with HD calling on so I can use data to conduct work while out on my appointments.  As soon as I don't need to use both at the same time, I disable HD voice so my calls are clearer and sound more natural.  Maybe in time, the HD Voice technology will improve and the calls through that software will sound as natural and good as when not using HD Voice.

I used that feature with TV/Audio remote apps and DSLR Camera remote apps, and already miss it. Kind of like when Samsung took the FM radio feature out after the S2. Last, but not least, S7's have a very small curve at the very edge of the screen that hinders use of any hard screen protectors. Overall, other than speed of processor the S5 still looks to be better in many ways, and I would give the S5 a 5-star where I give the S7 only 4.\r\n\r\nOn the touchscreen error issue, Verizon has locked out the keyboard commands that used to work on Galaxy's to get to things like touchscreen adjustments. I did find a \"touchscreen calibration\" app in Play store that has made the screen response tolerable, but still not as reliable as my S5's are.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should wait for the S8, when Samsung gives us back the IR port, and (dare I say?) the FM radio. Oh, and the touchscreen checkbox for those of us that wear gloves.

One of the things I have never liked TouchWiz.  They have consistently released a very poor GUI.  \r\n\r\nThe S7 is snappy compared to previous iterations while adding a lot more visual appeal. I've typically started off by loading a new launcher to my phone immediately so it was a surprise to see how nice the S7 was with just a few \"ascetic\" features such as changing the grid size and themes. \r\n\r\nThe options/settings menu is much better organized and easier to use  as well from previous releases.  But I'm disappointed that a few things like counting steps seems to be missing from the always on screen or lock screen. \r\n\r\nIt's also too bad that they don't upgrade TouchWiz to new versions on older phones. I typically upgrade for power so it really wouldn't change my buying habits or frequency.\r\n\r\nAs for the physical aspect, it's beautiful and the first Galaxy that really feels like a  premium phone for price tag.  I would rather be able to swap batteries as I have in the past but the 3000mAh battery is a nice and the battery life over all seems solid as does the charging speed.\r\n\r\nThe game launcher and game tools are also seem like a nice touch that I haven't had the chance to play with as much as I'd like. \r\n\r\nOverall, it meets most of my expectations.  I want to have more time with the camera but so far it looks fantastic. \r\n\r\nThe other thing, outside of TouchWiz that Samsung seems to always mess up is major updates and causing battery drain but we'll see how it handles the first big update.

And also the return of SD Ram slot and water resistance.  I have one big problem, the screen.  The screen display should be it best feature but for some reason Samsung chose to give it a slight barely noticeable curve on the edges (I am not talking about the S7 Edge version of the phone).  This slight curve makes it impossible to get almost any tempered glass screen display to fit properly on this unit.  You have to choose between tempered glass which does not cover the width of the screen or you can go with some models that try to fit the full width but won't stick on the curved edges and will allow dust underneath.  This may seem like a minor complaint but this phone is too expensive to go without a screen protector and all the ones available for the phone don't fit.  GS6 does not have this issue because the screen is perfectly flat a tempered glass fits perfectly.  It is annoying to the point where I may consider returning it because I have a screen protector that doesn't cover the entire screen and it looks terrible.  Search for every screen protector for this phone and read the reviews for the screen protector.  They are mostly bad reviews because they don't cpover the screen or they do cover it but won't stick on the edges.  Turns out that it is not the fault of the screen protector, it is the fault of the screen designed by Samsung.", "Submission Time": "2016-07-07", "Title": "Good device - one main problem", "Username": "mitch053"}, {"Review": "Still learning how to use all of the features but I like the phone.", "Submission Time": "2016-07-06", "Title": "Nice Phone", "Username": "cjones1908"}, {"Review": "Got hacked shortly after buying new phone.

So we're splitting the difference. Please note that the phones we had before were LG Spectrum II's so upgrading to a Galaxy S7 felt like walking out of the smartphone stone age.\r\n\r\nPros according to my sister:\r\nFast\r\nTakes amazing photos\r\nScreen is a good size\r\nAndroid\r\nDouble clicking the home button launches camera\r\nScreen capture with a gesture! Sweet.\r\nRuns apps and games really well. (Very important for Neko Atsume. Because cats are serious business.)\r\n\r\nCons according to my sister:\r\nBefore getting a case, the rounded screen kept registering touch along edges when the device was picked up or being held. Bought a case and no longer have this issue.\r\nGets warm to hot during use\r\nA little too slim\r\nLack of removable battery\r\nCost is high\r\n\r\nPros according to me:\r\n1) Fast (faster than my desktop computer that's how fast what is this witchcraft science?)\r\n2) Nice features\r\n3) Good size screen. Not tiny, not obnoxious\r\n4) Gold color I got mine in is pretty snazzy\r\n5) You can buy cases for them on Society6 and support an artist doing so.\r\n6) Easter egg in marshmallow is delightful.\r\n7) It scans apps you download for threats.\r\n8) Sometimes autocorrect makes me laugh.\r\n\r\nCons according to me:\r\n1) It gets fudging hot with not much use, which makes me nervous because my last phone overheating over and over during use is what eventually killed it.\r\n2) Battery is not removable. First phone I've owned like this. Not cool. What if it fails? What if it stops holding a charge? What if my phone does the same thing my past phones have done and constantly reboot until the battery is removed and replaced? Now I can't carry extra batteries in case of emergencies. Power packs are expensive and not practical for me.\r\n3) Stupidly expensive phone. Only got them because I've paid the cell bill for the last three years, so now I am trading this responsibility with my sister for two years.\r\n4) No physical keyboard (a rare thing for smartphones to have one nowadays. If you don't suffer from Zombie Finger this probably isn't an issue for you, but it is for me.)\r\n5) Phone is slim and slippery. I suggest a strong, grippy case if you drop things often.\r\n6) Due to assinine price this is the first phone I've owned that made me feel insurance was necessary. \r\n7) I typed this review on this phone and thanks to my Zombie Finger my blood pressure spiked at least a dozen times. Nice murder attempt, phone. I'm still alive. Try harder next time. (Please don't)\r\n8) Sometimes autocorrect makes me want to murder.\r\n9) It knows too much.\r\n\r\nBeen using the phone too long.

Called Verizon and had to talk to first and second level support to get the sound working on text notifications.

The S7 so far has made it to the end of the day with several phone calls and texts plus maybe 30 mins - 1 hr total of browsing or streaming video. Better than the last phone but not as good as you think it would be based on the extra weight. Very nice, fast and sharp camera. Great screen and I like the figerprint unlock. A couple flaws: the power button is too low to and interferes with my dashboard phone holder; The screen although it appears to be flat is actually curved back slightly on the two long edges, meaning that the glass ZAGG screen protector the Verizon rep convinced me to buy actually does not touch along the edges making it difficult when you are trying to slide apps around on the home screens - plus it is starting to catch some dirt. Regarding storage: the native memory is sufficient for most users, but I decided to mount an SD card for pics and video.

However, coming from an aging S4 (which is still a great phone), I am happy with this model. Minor quirks but overall a nice phone.\nPros:\n1) Very nice camera that doesn't lag as previous one did. Fast shutter speed and low light aperture compensates very nice in dim lit rooms.\n2) 32gb onboard this time is great. As many phones come with a standard 16gb, eaten up by the OS and updates doesn't leave much for user space. pair that with a nice size SD card and you shouldn't have to fret over space anymore.\n3) Battery is a bump up from the S5 (let's just forget the S6 battery even happened). It could have been a little bigger. I am all for battery life over how \"thin\" my phone can be. Yes it does have fast charging, which helps in a pinch.\n4) Fast RAM and processor is great. Smooth transition between apps and also the dual multitask split screen is great. Hope it stays this way if they don't kill it with updates\n5) IP68 waterproofing. Granted I'm not one to go test it and it's limitations, it's nice to know If I ever do drop it in water or get caught in rain or even splashed by kids or something, my device is safe.\n\nCons:\n1) Still slim and too slippery. Regardless of non-removable battery, the back is slick, curved glass. Too slippery to hold without a case. It looks great, just asking for trouble if dropped.\n2) Battery still small compared to the S7 edge or the S6 Active. Large batteries should be the norm with these ever-growing power hungry devices. Specs keep growing yet batteries stay the same.\n3) 4G vs 3G. If you happen to get in an area where 4G may not be available, you may be out of luck. If I go into a store or find myself between towns without 4G, this phone WILL NOT work on 3G. I could have a great signal with 3G and it may as well be in Airplane mode. With 4G, it is fast and works great. I'm not sure if it's the phone or all S7 devices. I have reset network settings, restored phone, etc. On 3G, just a white screen and the loading circle, then \"cannot connect to network\".\n4) Speaker on the bottom is nice, yet still not that loud compared to some peoples phones that I hear.

I've also noticed that certain email apps fail to deliver push notifications (mainly the Yahoo mail app & after trying quite a few things including clearing the phone's cache & clearing the cache on the app, the only way I've gotten it to work again before it decides to fail again, is to completely uninstall it & then install it again.)\n\nOver all I've very pleased with this latest Samsung phone & I'm very glad to have purchased it.", "Submission Time": "2016-03-29", "Title": "Impressive phone", "Username": "gchildjr"}, {"Review": "After two weeks of using this great phone, the screen went black.

There are however a few things I may change with this phone or phones to come out in the future. The S7's design is elegant and smooth, but, with this smoothness comes a con. If your hands have any sort of moisture or natural skin oil on them this thing feels like it will slip right out of your hand. I highly recommend a case (who doesn't buy one?). The other con I have is the battery life. This is probably due to the fact I came from the Note3 and it has a much larger battery capacity. I was literally watching the battery go down with light usage, the power saver feature on and the screen brightness as low as I could have it and still make out what is was on it (I closed all backround apps).

I personally repaired the screen on my S4 at least 4 times including the digitizer as well one time. This is much more difficult on the S7. The battery life on this phone hasn't impressed me yet either. The phone has always made it through the day for me, but sometimes it will barely make it to 9:30 or 10 PM. From the battery stats screen, android system and android OS are the culprits with the most battery usage, which tells me that perhaps a software upgrade could improve battery life. The screen colors look great, the camera comes up quick and focuses even quicker, Samsung pay works well, I love being able to take the phone in the shower and listen to music, the always on display works well and is handy, performance and multitasking works very well, and call quality is top notch (especially HD voice).

Camera is also very good from the few tests I've done in the past week, and I love the microSD card slot. My only gripe is the battery. Maybe I had my expectations set too high before I got the phone but it doesn't seem to be holding a charge like a brand-new battery with this capacity should. \r\n\r\nMy older phone was a little over 2 years old and had a 2300mAh battery (HTC One M7). On a daily basis I use my phone at work minimally - check email a few times, browse the internet at lunch, etc. and maybe a few texts, but that's it. No gaming, no extensive browsing or app usage. I even hibernate apps I'm not using to save battery. My old phone would hit about 50% battery at lunch time and around 2:00pm I'd have to charge it so it wouldn't die before the end of the day. I expected that from an old phone with a smaller (by today's standards) battery. \r\n\r\nThe new S7 has a 3000mAh battery, should hold a charge like a new battery, and is using a newer version of Android which is supposed to be \"more efficient\". With the same usage, I'm finding that the battery is around 60% after using it at lunch time. Somehow I was expecting to go home after work with 60%+ battery left....maybe that expectation isn't realistic? It just seems like it wouldn't hold up at all to a full day of photos, web usage, navigation, etc. if I was out on vacation or something. \r\n\r\nAgain, overall this is a great phone, and it's not like the battery is worse than what I had previously.

I have to say while the S7 has some nice features, the camera and water resistance at the top of that list, I don't like it as well as my S5. Overall it just feels like many of the apps require more clicks to get to your end result than the S5 did, particularly with texts and calendars.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, my phone is a phone. I use the phone, calendar and text features and a little bit as a camera. It is not a gaming device or mobile internet surfing device for me generally. I use the text feature almost as often as I talk. I find the text apps on the S7 more cumbersome. It requires more steps to delete messages and the auto-correct feature is my new nemesis. Super cool when I have typed correctly the word I want and it gets changed. This becomes a battle of wills and ultimately the check mark wins. It is frustrating that it requires several clicks to tell the phone that yes, indeed I am not incapable. To delete a text requires pulling down an additional menu and confirming at least twice that you want the text deleted. So happy my phone has my back and wants to really verify that I know what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nAll kidding and minor annoyances aside,  the camera on this phone is a decent quality. I am a DSLR camera person so no cell phone out there right now matches that for me but for a cell phone camera I find the S7 convenient and sharp with some nice editing features. I do like the low light option and found that it does well without being blurry or overly saturated with background light. Having additional storage for those photos and music files is also a great feature.\r\n\r\nUltimately, in this day and age, to cling to an old favorite is like insisting your old vinyl was better than your iPod and digital downloads. To each their own, technology moves forward anyway. For me personally, I don't like having the extra steps on my text apps and calendar.

If you care about themes and fonts more than reliability with apps and Bluetooth, android is for you.

I had a Casio  g one and it was built lIke a tank.  It wasn't fast but it was unbreakable.  Also, waterproof, and even with continues use, it would last a few days.   Not this s7,  I tried on day one to use this phone as much as I had the g one, Pandora, email, couple phone calls.  By 9 am, battery was showing connect charger.   That night I turned it off charged it again, I found a battery setting to conserve battery, and I still has to use restraint on how I used it.  Simply setting ring tones, background etc, drained it.   So I tried to second battery conservation setting, this actually helped make it through the day, but here is my argument, if I have to disable so many features that are on this phone,just to make it through the day as a phone, I could have saved my money and gotten a flip phone.   By the time you disable  data, WiFi, Bluetooth, email, etc all you have is a super expansive, super fragile phone.   I will say this, I like this phone, the features are awesome , but I can't use them unless I'm at home cause I don't have a car charger and this thing drinks batteries like a hummer drinks  gas.  This thing is awesome with the head gear from oculus the vr gear is cool.  Just make sure you are on WiFi or you will go through 2 gigs of data in about 5 minutes, we learned the hard way.   Also, this phone is really hot to the touch while using this  head  gear.   Another thing about the oculus is every game,video, etc  that you do saves to your phone's storage.    I Haven't mentioned much about the  fragility of this but, coming from a g  zone that I could throw up in the air and it still was perfect when I picked it up going to this  Samsung s 7 is difficult.  I'm a heavy user.  I'm in sales, I need my email, etc, if I need my Casio, I can use it knowing it week will l be there at the end of the day.  I've dropped it on concrete floors more than I can count.   This new phone has me so scared to drop it, I can't or won't put it in my pocket, cause it's so fragile.   So I leave it in the car.   Kind of useless honestly.    I have big issues with all smartphone makers today.  If you can make a Casio g zone that I can beat up for 6 yrs and it functions perfectly, why can you not do it now ? I want a phone I'm not scared to use..... and don't say you need a case.  I should not have to buy a case that costs half the price of this stupid phone.   If the phone is that fragile, the case should have come with it.  I would much rather had a good case than  the 99.00 vr head gear.   My problem isn't with Samsung it's with Verizon, please start offering more rugged phones.  The  technology is their. Hello Casio.

The camera is noticeably inferior to the one I had and the stock camera program is frustrating. What I find is that every app they present you with needs to be replaced with an aftermarket one that meets your expectations, but doesn't quite sync well with the phone. I've also noticed I have to click, swipe, or drag about 40% more to do the same operations I used to do. Could some of this be OS switch syndrome?

Apparently most that review this phone are Samsung phone loyalists... \r\nMy last phone was an LG G4, my first LG phone ever.  I would gladly go back to it albeit for mother board bricking issues. I have had to reboot this phone multiple times due to lag or freezing up. The call clarity as well as speaker volume is horrendous!  The touchwiz user interface is terrible and antiquated.  Feels and looks too much like an icrapper. I would honestly go back to my 8+yr old Motorola Razor instead of having this phone!  Do yourself a favor and specifically choose a phone with superb call clarity as well as loud volume. Camera is mediocre at best, edited software I terrible, no IR support and not so good battery life in my opinion. \r\nYou WILL be disappointed with the S7, I know I am....
